  <h1>GHURLBot manual</h1>

  <p>GHURLBot is an IRC bot that gives the full URLs for GitHub issues
    and users. It typically has the nick name ‘ghurlbot’ on IRC.</p>

  <h2>IRC commands</h2>

  <p>When somebody types <code>#</code> plus a number, GHURLBot
    responds with the full URL to the issue or pull request with that
    number. E.g.:</p>

  <pre class=command>&lt;joe&gt; Let's talk about #13.
&lt;ghurlbot&gt; -> 13 https://github.com/xxx/yyy/issues/13</pre>

  <p>(The <code>-&gt;</code> is understood
    by <a href="https://w3c.github.io/scribe2/scribedoc.html"
    >scribe.perl</a> and causes the URL to be formatted as a link when
    scribe.perl generates HTML from the IRC log.)</p>

  <p>When somebody types <code>@</code> plus a name, it responds with
    the full URL to that person or team. E.g.:</p>

  <pre class=command>&lt;joe&gt; That comment came from @aliciag
&lt;ghurlbot&gt; -&gt; @aliciag https://github.com/aliciag</pre>

  <p>GHURLBot only expands a reference that is on in its own, not
    one that seems to be attached to something else, such as a URL
    (e.g., ‘example.com/slides#13’). If GHURLBot does not seem
    to recognize a reference, try to put spaces around it.</p>

  <h3>Specifying the GitHub repository</h3>

  <p>To be able to expand issues and pull requests, the bot first
    needs to know the repository that is being discussed:</p>

  <pre class=command>&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, discussing https://github.com/xxx/yyy</pre>

  <p>Instead of <code>discussing</code>, you can also
    use <code>discuss</code>, <code>use</code>, <code>using</code>, <code>take
    up</code>, <code>taking up</code>, <code>this will be</code>
    or <code>this is</code>.</p>

  <p>The prefix ‘https://github.com/’ is assumed, so you can also say:</p>

  <pre class=command>&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, discussing xxx/yyy</pre>

  <p>And if you switch to a different repository with the same owner,
    you can also omit the owner:</p>

  <pre class=command>&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, discussing yyy</pre>

  <p>GHURLBot remembers the last repository even when it is
    dismissed from a channel. When it is later asked to rejoin, it
    continues using the last repository.</p>

  <h3>Suspending the expansion of references</h3>

  <p>You can turn the bot off temporarily without dismissing it from
    the channel and turn it back on again:</p>

  <pre class=command>&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, off
&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, on</pre>

  <p>You can ask the bot to stop expanding just persons and teams:</p>

  <pre class=command>&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, set names to off
&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, names off
&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, names = off</pre>

  <p>Instead of <code>off</code>, you can also use <code>no</code>
    or <code>false</code>. And instead of <code>names</code> you can
    also use <code>persons</code> or <code>teams</code>.</p>

  <p>To ask it to stop expanding references to issues and pull requests,
    the command is:</p>

  <pre class=command>&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, set issues to off
&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, issues off
&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, issues = off</pre>

  <p>To turn the expansion of references back on,
    replace <code>off</code> by <code>on</code>, <code>yes</code>
    or <code>true</code>.</p>

  <p>When you address GHURLBot directly, it will respond even if
    expansion of references is suspended:</p>

  <pre class=command>&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, #13 and #14?
&lt;ghurlbot&gt; -&gt; #13 https://github.com/xxx/yyy/issues/13
&lt;ghurlbot&gt; -&gt; #14 https://github.com/xxx/yyy/issues/14</pre>
  <h3>Inviting and dismissing the bot</h3>

  <p>You can invite the bot to a channel and dismiss it:</p>

  <pre class=command>&lt;joe&gt; /invite GHURLBot
&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, bye</pre>

  <h3>Reducing the number of responses from the bot</h3>

  <p>To avoid flooding the IRC conversation with links, the bot will
    not expand a reference if it has already expanded the same
    reference recently. By default, it waits until 15 lines have been
    typed into the IRC channel before expanding the same reference
    again, but that can be configured. All of the following set the
    delay to 20 lines:</p>

  <pre class=command>&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, set delay to 20
&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, delay 20
&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, delay = 20</pre>

  <p>The delay only stops the bot from reacting to normal messages in
    the channel. When you address GHURLBot directly, it will
    respond even if it gave the same URL recently.</p>

  <h3>Inquiring about the current status</h3>

  <p>You can ask what repository it is currently using:</p>

  <pre class=command>&lt;joe&gt; ghurlbot, status?
&lt;ghurlbot&gt; Delay is 15 lines, issues are on, names are on and I'm using https://github.com/xxx/yyy</pre>

  <h3>Getting help</h3>

  <p>The bot also reacts to <code>help</code> with some information
    about itself and a link to this manual.</p>

  <h3>Source</h3>

  <p>GHURLBot is written in Perl.
    The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/GHURLBot" >source</a> is on
