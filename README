GHURLBot is an IRC bot that provides full URLs when GitGub issues
(‘#123’) or users (‘@yyyy’) are mentioned in IRC. E.g.:

   <joe> Let's discuss issue #13.
   <ghurlbot> -> #13 https://github.com/xxx/yyy/issues/13

Instructions for running the bot are included in the ghurlbot.pl file.
Download the file and run perldoc to see the manual page. (Requires
perl.) E.g.:

   perldoc -oman ghurlbot.pl

The interaction with the bot in IRC is documented in manual.html:
